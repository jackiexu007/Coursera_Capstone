    "\n",
    "We first use the coordinates of the city center, to generate a group of cells, covering most of the Vancouver city (a circular area with radius approx. 5 kilometers centred around the city center). These cells are circles with radius 250 meters, named as neighborhood candidates.\n",

    "We then utilize Foursquare API to explore neighborhoods data. In order to use the Foursquare location data, we need to get the latitude and longtitude coordinates of each neighborhood. Once we have the latitude and longtitude data, we can leverage Foursquare API to explore venues information for each neighborhood in the city of Vancouver. Some features extracted include 'Venue', 'Venue Category', 'Venue Latitude', 'Venue Longitude', etc. We are particularly interested in the venues within Japanese restaurant category.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Analysis**\n",
    "\n",
    "We explore nearby venues of each neighborhood centers and focus on Japanese restaurants. We care about two properties of the neighborhood information: the number of Japanese restaurants in the area and the closest distance from the neighborhood center to any Japanese restaurant. Finally, we will use KMeans to cluster and recommend locations with no more than one Japanese restaurant in neiborhood area (approx. 250 meters) and no Japanese restaurant within 400 meters' distance from the neighborhood centers. Besides, these locations are within 3 kilometers' distance from the city center."
